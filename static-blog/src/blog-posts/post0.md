## What is Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting 
elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown 
is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is 
different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, 
you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible 
immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdownformatted 
file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases 
should look different.
